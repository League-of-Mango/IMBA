# Built-In Resource Packs

This is a description of every Minecraft resource pack that is built into the modpack.

## [Verity](https://github.com/League-of-Mango/Svalbard/raw/main/minecraft/resourcepacks/Verity.zip)

An edited version of the [Team FaithfulPack's](https://www.faithfulpack.net) [Classic Faithful 32x32 Programmer Art Resource Pack](https://www.faithfulpack.net/classicfaithful/32x-programmer-art).<br>
Not only are Vattic's old 32x32 vanilla textures present, but also textures of newer blocks are made in Vattic's style for Programmer Art.

Verity takes the Faithful pack one step further and uses some of the improved non-Programmer Art textures for some blocks as well as some small tweaks.

The tweaks that Verity makes include:
* New Wheat Textures
* New Beehive Textures
* Textures for Beehive stages
* Telescoping Piston Heads
* Colored Ping Indicators

## Copper Legacy Pack

Updates Vanilla Copper textures to look like other metals more.

## Quark Programmer Art

Programmer Art textures for [Vazkii's](https://vazkii.net) [Quark Mod](https://quarkmod.net) and are built-in with Quark.

## [Better Iron Chests](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/better-iron-chests)

Changes the textures of all Iron Chests chests to look more like the Minecraft 1.12 version of Iron Chests.
