## Modpack Description

A kitchen sink semi-expert style modpack aimed to be accessible for those who are new to modded Minecraft while still providing expert-style gameplay for veteran players.

There will be quests to guide players through mod progression and highlight interesting tools. There will also be many recipes and processes that will require the utilization of multiple mods.

Two versions of the modpack will exist: **[Premium Edition](https://github.com/KennyN-UCSD/Inter-Mango-Bizarre-Adventure/blob/main/Inter%20Mangos%20Bizarre%20Adventure-0.3.2.zip)** and **Potato Edition**.

The **Premium Edition** features many mods which enhance graphics and add extra flavor to the game.\
This edition comes with [Complementary Shaders](https://www.complementary.dev) pre-installed, which are designed to look fantastic while still being compatible with modded Minecraft.

The **Potato Edition** does not contain these extras mods as well as some mods that would be useful in a singleplayer world to minimize necessary content. Preset options are also included to optimize the game immediately.

The modpack is still in development and many more additions are to be made.

## Installation

1. Install the latest version of either the **[Premium](https://github.com/KennyN-UCSD/Inter-Mango-Bizarre-Adventure/blob/main/Inter%20Mangos%20Bizarre%20Adventure-0.3.2.zip)** or **Potato** edition of **Inter Mango's Bizarre Adventure**.
2. Install **[PrismLauncher](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/releases/tag/6.3)**. PrismLauncher is a lightweight Minecraft instance manager that allows for easy installation and updating of mods and modpacks. The modpack should be able to installed on any instance manager, but this is the best one.
3. Copy and Paste the modpack .zip file into PrismLauncher.
4. In PrismLauncher settings or Settings in the Edit Instance tab, set the Java Installation to a 64 bit **Java 17** Installation (javaw.exe), easily done using Auto Detect. If **Java 17** is not installed, you may install it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) or [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17). One may work better than the other.
5. Allocate RAM to the modpack. Users with **16+ GB** of RAM should allocate a **minimum of 4GB (4096MB)** and a **maximum of 8GB (8192MB) or 10GB (10240MB)** of RAM. Allocating more than 8 GB of RAM may actually lower performance. Users with **8 GB of RAM** should allocate a **minimum of 2GB (2049MB)** and a **maximum of 4GB (4096MB)** of RAM. Users with less RAM than that probably cannot run the pack at all.
6. Add the following to the JVM Arguments section to make Java run better:
>-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -XX:G1NewSizePercent=30 -XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent=40 -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=8M -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 -XX:G1HeapWastePercent=5 -XX:G1MixedGCCountTarget=4 -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=15 -XX:G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent=90 -XX:G1RSetUpdatingPauseTimePercent=5 -XX:SurvivorRatio=32 -XX:+PerfDisableSharedMem -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=1
7. Click Launch to finish installation and to open the modpack.
8. If you have any trouble installing the modpack, contact Kenny for assistance.
